# React Minesweeper

This is a Minesweeper game built following [@tdelev](https://github.com/tdelev)'s tutorial [Minesweeper in TypeScript and React](https://medium.com/@tdelev/minesweeper-in-typescript-and-react-f5f8a5d57383).

## Instructions
- Clone or download the repository
- Install the dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn install`)
- Run the app (`npm start` or `yarn start`)

## Objectives

For now, I am just studying the tutorial code and adding it here as I'm ready to move forward.
Then, I will do some changes by myself:
- Refactor
- Add new functionalities
- Add tests
